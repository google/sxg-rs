This `prefetch.html` fetches an SXG and navigates to it. After the navigation,
the `window.location` will be changed to `fallback.html`.
To reload this page, care must be taken to reload from `prefetch.html`,
rather than from `fallback.html`.
If the user clicks browser's `reload` button after the navigation, the browser
will reload `fallback.html`, and it will result in a error.
